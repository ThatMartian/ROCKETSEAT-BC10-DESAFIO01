# Build A Portfolio Website

With all of the projects you will be working on here at Lambda School, you will need somewhere to house them!  There is no better opportunity to learn and show off your skills than a beautiful portfolio website.  

You have the ability to write HTML, CSS, and responsive media queries.  You also know how to identify and write responsive units.  It's time to put that knowledge into action by reading someone else's code and adding your own flavor.  You will be building a portfolio website from a template found on [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/).
